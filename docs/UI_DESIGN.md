# UI/UX Design for LLM Consensus Benchmark

This document outlines the user interface and experience design for the LLM Consensus Benchmark application.

## Design Principles

1. **Clarity**: Present information in a clear, easily digestible manner
2. **Responsiveness**: Provide immediate feedback for user actions
3. **Accessibility**: Ensure the application is usable by everyone
4. **Simplicity**: Focus on core functionality without unnecessary complexity
5. **Visual Hierarchy**: Guide users through the interface with clear visual cues

## Color Palette

```
Primary: #3B82F6 (Blue)
Secondary: #10B981 (Green)

+-------------------------------------------------------+
|                                                       |
| Prompt Input:                                         |

| [x] GPT-4 [ ] Claude 3 [x] Gemini [x] Grok ...       |
|                                                       |
| +---------------------------------------------------+ |
| |                                                   | |

| |                Response Grid                      | |
| |                                                   | |
| |                                                   | |

| +---------------------------------------------------+ |
| |                                                   | |
| |              Consensus Visualization              | |
| |                                                   | |
| +---------------------------------------------------+ |
|                                                       |
+-------------------------------------------------------+
```

### Response Grid

The response grid will use a responsive grid layout:
- Desktop: 4-5 cards per row
- Tablet: 2-3 cards per row
- Mobile: 1-2 cards per row

### Response Card Design

```
+------------------------+
|      Model Name        |
|      Provider          |
+------------------------+
|                        |
|    "Single word"       |
|                        |
+------------------------+
|   Response time: 1.2s  |
+------------------------+
```

Cards will have a subtle shadow and rounded corners. The background color will match the consensus group color (with appropriate text contrast).

## Interactive Elements

### Prompt Input

- Clear text input field with placeholder text
- Submit button with loading state
- Character counter (if implementing limits)
- Example prompts or suggestions

### Model Selection

- Checkbox list with model names and providers
- Toggle all/none options
- Search/filter functionality for many models
- Visual indication of selected models

### Response Cards

- Loading spinner while waiting for response
- Highlight effect when new responses arrive
- Click to expand for additional details
- Visual indication of consensus grouping

### Consensus Visualization

- Horizontal bar chart showing response distribution
- Color-coded bars matching response card colors
- Percentage or count labels
- Legend for color mapping

## Responsive Design

The application will be fully responsive:

### Desktop (1024px+)
- Full layout as described above
- Sidebar navigation for additional pages
- Expanded visualizations

### Tablet (768px - 1023px)
- Stacked layout with narrower components
- Collapsible navigation
- Slightly simplified visualizations

### Mobile (< 768px)
- Single column layout
- Hamburger menu for navigation
- Simplified visualizations
- Scrollable model selection

## Loading States

- Skeleton loaders for initial page load
- Spinner indicators for API requests
- Progress indicators for long operations
- Pulsing effects for real-time updates

## Animations and Transitions

- Subtle fade-in for new responses
- Smooth transitions between states
- Progress animations for loading states
- Micro-interactions for user feedback

## Accessibility Considerations

- Proper contrast ratios for all text
- Keyboard navigation support
- Screen reader compatibility
- Focus indicators for interactive elements
- Alternative text for visualizations
- Resizable text support

## Error States

- Clear error messages with recovery options
- Inline validation for form inputs
- Fallback UI for failed components
- Retry mechanisms for failed requests

## Empty States

- Helpful guidance for first-time users
- Suggestions for getting started
- Visual illustrations for empty sections
- Call-to-action buttons

## User Flow

1. **Initial Load**
   - User sees the main page with empty prompt input
   - Default models are pre-selected
   - Empty response grid with placeholder

2. **Model Selection**
   - User selects/deselects models to include
   - UI updates to show selected models

3. **Prompt Submission**
   - User enters a prompt and submits
   - Loading indicators appear in response grid
   - Submit button shows loading state

4. **Receiving Responses**
   - Responses appear in real-time as they arrive
   - Cards transition from loading to completed state
   - Consensus visualization updates dynamically

5. **Viewing Results**
   - User can see all responses and consensus
   - Can interact with visualization for more details
   - Option to save or share results

6. **New Prompt**
   - User can submit a new prompt
   - Previous results are archived
   - Process repeats

## Implementation Notes

- Use Tailwind CSS for styling
- Implement responsive design using Tailwind's breakpoint utilities
- Use React for interactive components
- Consider using Framer Motion for animations
- Ensure all components are accessible
- Test on multiple devices and screen sizes
