# Implementation Steps for LLM Consensus Benchmark

This document provides a step-by-step guide for implementing the LLM Consensus Benchmark application.

## Phase 1: Project Setup and Basic Structure

### 1.1 Initialize Project
- [ ] Create a new Astro project
  ```bash
  npm create astro@latest llm-consensus-benchmark
  ```
- [ ] Add React and Tailwind CSS integrations
  ```bash
  npx astro add react tailwind
  ```
- [ ] Set up TypeScript configuration
- [ ] Configure ESLint and Prettier

### 1.2 Supabase Setup
- [ ] Create a new Supabase project
- [ ] Set up database tables according to the data model in [LLM_BENCHMARK_PLAN.md](./LLM_BENCHMARK_PLAN.md)
- [ ] Create database migrations
- [ ] Set up Supabase client in the application

### 1.3 Basic UI Components
- [ ] Create the main layout
- [ ] Implement the header component
- [ ] Create a basic prompt input form
- [ ] Set up the model selection interface (static for now)
- [ ] Create placeholder components for the response grid and consensus visualization

## Phase 2: OpenRouter Integration

### 2.1 OpenRouter API Client
- [ ] Create an OpenRouter API client utility
- [ ] Implement model fetching functionality
- [ ] Set up completion request handling
- [ ] Add error handling and timeout management

### 2.2 Model Management
- [ ] Fetch available models from OpenRouter
- [ ] Store model information in Supabase
- [ ] Implement model selection and toggling functionality
- [ ] Create the settings page for model management

### 2.3 Prompt Submission
- [ ] Implement the prompt submission API endpoint
- [ ] Set up parallel requests to selected models
- [ ] Create response handling and storage logic
- [ ] Implement real-time updates using Supabase Realtime

## Phase 3: Visualization and Analysis

### 3.1 Response Display
- [ ] Create the response grid component
- [ ] Implement individual response cards
- [ ] Add loading indicators for pending responses
- [ ] Display response times and model information

### 3.2 Consensus Analysis
- [ ] Implement the consensus analysis algorithm
- [ ] Group similar responses
- [ ] Assign colors to different consensus groups
- [ ] Store consensus data in Supabase

### 3.3 Visualization
- [ ] Create the consensus visualization component
- [ ] Implement a bar chart for response distribution
- [ ] Add interactive elements to the visualization
- [ ] Ensure the visualization updates in real-time

### 3.4 Historical Data
- [ ] Create the history page
- [ ] Implement prompt history fetching
- [ ] Create UI for browsing past prompts and responses
- [ ] Add filtering and sorting options

## Phase 4: Refinement and Optimization

### 4.1 Performance Optimization
- [ ] Optimize API calls and database queries
- [ ] Implement caching for identical prompts
- [ ] Add pagination for large datasets
- [ ] Optimize real-time updates

### 4.2 Error Handling
- [ ] Improve error handling for API failures
- [ ] Add retry mechanisms for failed requests
- [ ] Create user-friendly error messages
- [ ] Implement fallback UI for error states

### 4.3 UI/UX Enhancements
- [ ] Refine the visual design
- [ ] Add animations for state transitions
- [ ] Improve mobile responsiveness
- [ ] Enhance accessibility

### 4.4 Additional Features
- [ ] Add export functionality (CSV, JSON)
- [ ] Implement prompt templates
- [ ] Add user preferences
- [ ] Create a dashboard for usage statistics

## Phase 5: Testing and Deployment

### 5.1 Testing
- [ ] Write unit tests for core functionality
- [ ] Create integration tests for API endpoints
- [ ] Implement end-to-end tests for critical user flows
- [ ] Perform performance testing

### 5.2 Deployment
- [ ] Set up production environment variables
- [ ] Configure Supabase for production
- [ ] Deploy frontend to Vercel or Netlify
- [ ] Set up monitoring and logging

### 5.3 Documentation
- [ ] Create user documentation
- [ ] Document API endpoints
- [ ] Add code comments and documentation
- [ ] Create a README with setup instructions

### 5.4 Launch
- [ ] Perform final testing
- [ ] Gather initial user feedback
- [ ] Make necessary adjustments
- [ ] Official launch

## Development Approach

### Iterative Development
- Focus on getting a minimal viable product (MVP) working first
- Implement core features before adding enhancements
- Get feedback early and often
- Refine based on user testing

### Code Organization
- Follow the component structure outlined in [LLM_BENCHMARK_PLAN.md](./LLM_BENCHMARK_PLAN.md)
- Use TypeScript interfaces for type safety
- Create reusable components and utilities
- Maintain clear separation of concerns

### Collaboration
- Use Git for version control
- Create clear commit messages
- Document decisions and trade-offs
- Maintain up-to-date documentation

## Next Steps

1. Initialize the Astro project
2. Set up Supabase
3. Create the basic UI components
4. Implement the OpenRouter API client

Once these initial steps are complete, you'll have a foundation to build upon for the rest of the implementation.
